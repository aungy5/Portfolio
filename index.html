                  Created a command line interface that allows users to create an HTML page that stores basic information about each member of their team. The user does not have to code anything, they simply need to enter the information they would like on the page, and it will be rendered into a sleek UI that they can access as soon as they are finished answering the questions. This page can then be used as an employee directory, where team members can have an easy access point to basic information about the other employees on their team.

                  ReadMe files are the hallmark of well-kept applications. They can, however, be a pain to create as users must remember a wide variety of information that must be included in the readME. To solve this problem I created a command line interface where users will be prompted for everything that is required in a readme. After they answer the prompts, their answers will be dynamically infused into a well-formatted ReadMe that includes all necessary information regarding licensing, usage instructions, testing protocols, and more.

                  For our first project, we created an app that would help people find a book to read. There are plenty of book sites on the internet, but we wanted to consolidate all the data these sites provide into a one-stop-shop for the user. 
                  We were able to do this by using the Google Books and NYT api. As we worked on this app more and more we realized this could be a very valuable tool for 
                  librarians to use when they need to help a person find a book to read. We discovered that librarians have many tools that account for literary merit, 
                  but not necessarily trends or popularity. With our app, librarians can ensure that their collections include popular and relevant works for a given topic.
